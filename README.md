A screenshot tool that can
- Capture the entire screen
- Capture a user-selected area on the screen

then either
- Upload that image to imgur. You get a notification if the upload was successful, and 
  the link to the image will be pasted to your clipboard.
- Save the data to disk
- Open it with an application of your choice (An image viewer, for example)

It depends on `scrot`, `xclip`, and `zenity` command line tools.
