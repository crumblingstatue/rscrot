A screenshot tool that can
- Capture the entire screen
- Capture a user-selected area on the screen

then either
- Upload that image to imgur
- Save the data to disk
- View it in an image viewer (right now feh)

It's in a pretty messy state right now, as it was only for personal use until now.
It depends on `scrot`, `xclip`, and `zenity` command line tools.
