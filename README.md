A screenshot tool that can
- Capture the entire screen
- Capture a user-selected area on the screen

then either
- Save the data to disk
- Open it with an application of your choice (An image viewer, for example)
- Copy it to clipboard. Wow.

It's in a pretty messy state right now, as it was only for personal use until now.
It depends on `maim`, `xclip`, and `zenity` command line tools.
